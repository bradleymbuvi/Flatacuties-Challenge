# Flatacuties-Challenge

An app where you can vote for the cutest animal!

Core Deliverables:
As a user, I can:

1. See a list of all animal names by making a GET request to the following endpoint to retrieve the character data.

2. Click on an animal’s name to see its details i.e image and number of votes. Note, you should only be displaying the details of one animal at a time. You can either use the character information from your first request, or make a new request to this endpoint to get the character's details.

3.  When viewing an animal’s details, I should be able to add the number of votes for each animal. This number of votes should then be displayed together with the animal’s details. No persistence is needed for the votes.
